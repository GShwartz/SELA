# Password Validator GIT POC

I've cloned my repo to a local repo and tried to update it but came across an authentication error so <br />
I stopped there and updated the repo from the GitHub GUI since this project is time limited.

- I've tried to create a new ssh keypair and added it to my account's SSH list.
- I've tried to limit the SSH key only to the SELA repo.
